    For the fig swirl, melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add brown sugar and stir to dissolve. Halve all of
    the figs and toss into a saucepan with water and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until you
    have a chunky-jammy mixture. Add salt with one or two stirs, set aside, and let cool completely.

    Ice Cream: In a small pot over medium heat, combine milk and granulated sugar until sugar is completely dissolved
    and the milk is just barely lukewarm. Whisk in the egg yolks. Set mixture in the fridge and wait until the fig
    mixture is cooled.

    Using an ice cream machine, pour liquids into the frozen basin and process using manufacturers instructions, ie. let
    spin and thickden for 20 minutes before adding marscapone, fig-jam mixture and the nuts. Continue to process for +/-
    10 minutes. Pour semi-frozen mixture into Pyrex dish or glass tupperware. Freeze for atleast 2 hours before serving.
